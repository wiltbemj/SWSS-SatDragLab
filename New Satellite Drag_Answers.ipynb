    "## Introduction\n",
    "The start link Starlink satellite system is a large constellation of relatively small (250 kg) satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) that provides internet services. These satellites orbit at altitudes of between 540 km and 570 km. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink) One of the goals of this lab is to understand how these spacecraft are affected by the Earth's thermosphere and if these orbits can be \"cleaned\" by solar storms. In this first notebook, you will explore how the atmospheric drag force affects the spacecraft orbit and how long it takes for drag to significantly affect the orbit.   "
